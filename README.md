RealMixGAN: Accelerating GAN Convergence by Leaking Real Data Distribution into the Latent Space
This repository contains the implementation and visualizations for the RealMixGAN project performed during the IEEE CIS Kolkata Chapter Summer Internship 2025. The project explores a generator-input mixing strategy where noisy projections of real images are leaked into the generator latent space to accelerate convergence and improve mode coverage on MNIST.
Included:
- Reproducible PyTorch implementation of Standard GAN and RealMixGAN.
- Training scripts that produce loss curves, Wasserstein distance metrics, and sample images.
- Visualizations and final figures in `outputs/` and `docs/figures/`.
- Internship report (PDF) in `docs/` 
## Requirements
Install with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Open `notebooks/RealMixGAN.ipynb` for an interactive walkthrough or run the training script:
python src/train.py
This script trains both Standard GAN and RealMixGAN for the preset number of epochs and saves outputs to `outputs/` and sample figures to `docs/figures/`.
## Repository layout
`src/` contains dataset loader, model definitions, trainer, and visualization helpers. `notebooks/` contains the interactive notebook. `docs/` contains the internship report and final figures.
## Results
Final figures and generated images are saved to `outputs/` and `docs/figures/`.
